## about
This is a snake game made in rust. I have only tried rust once before and I did not get very far. Now I have tried to make a snake game and it was basically easy and fun. This includes an alpine-based development container.

## files
* src/
** snake.rs - game logic (library)
** cli.rs - command line driver (binary)
* env/
** build.sh - build the development container
** run.sh - run the development container
